# Verify Session Files

**Purpose:** Check that /q-end, /q-checkpoint, or /q-save worked correctly.

## Step 1: Check Transcripts

```bash
ls -la .q-system/transcripts/*$(date +%Y-%m-%d)* 2>/dev/null
```

For each file found:
- Show filename
- Show creation time
- Show line count: `wc -l [file]`

## Step 2: Check Session Notes

```bash
ls -la .q-system/session-notes/*$(date +%Y-%m-%d)* 2>/dev/null
```

For each file found:
- Show filename
- Show creation time
- Show line count

## Step 3: Check Checkpoints

```bash
ls -la .q-system/checkpoints/*$(date +%Y-%m-%d)* 2>/dev/null
```

List all checkpoints from today with times.

## Step 4: Check Git Status

```bash
git status
git log -1 --format="%h %s (%cr)"
```

Show:
- Clean working tree or uncommitted changes
- Last commit hash, message, and time

## Step 5: Report

```

- After /q-end to confirm it worked
- After /q-checkpoint to verify save
- After /q-save to see what was captured
- When resuming to see what exists from previous work
